                        <p class="project-description">This project marked my introduction to game development using Unity. Created in late 2021, it showcases my initial exploration of game mechanics, design, and interactivity.<br>The game is a puzzle-solving experience where players must clear the board strategically. Each piece moves in the direction indicated by an arrow, requiring careful planning to access inner pieces by first moving the outer ones. Adding to the challenge, the game features turn limits and 15 handcrafted puzzle levels, all designed by me. This project represents the foundation of my skills in Unity and puzzle design, combining creativity and logic to craft an engaging and rewarding gameplay experience.</p>
